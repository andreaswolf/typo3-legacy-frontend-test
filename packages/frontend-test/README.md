# Frontend testing extension

This extension helps setting up a full-blown test system that can be called via HTTP, based on test cases similar to those used for functional tests.

Each test system has a full, isolated database and file environment available. Given appropriate server configuration, it can be called via a web browser and therefore used for frontend tests e.g. with [Cypress](https://cypress.io).
